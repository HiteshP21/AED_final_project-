 
# INFO5100-Final-Project
Our Project aims at helping Farmers requesting raw materials like biocides, manure, etc from warehouses and fulfilling customer and storemart needs by providing them with their crop needs.
The farmers also get a yield review from the customers and the supermarkets and get an insight into the quality of the crops and their satisfaction needs.
Our project will help such farmers by provisioning them with 
- Weather assistance
- raw materials
- sending their crops to StoreMarkets and manufacturers
- Getting an insight on Yield demand using a bar and line graph
